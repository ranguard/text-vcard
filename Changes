1.99 Wed 30th Aug 2006
    - Added 'quoted-printable' fix [rt.cpan.org #17790]
      this requires MIME::QuotedPrint

1.98 Mon Jul 17 2006
    - Test fix

1.97 Sun Jul  2 2006
    - removed test because I don't think Test::More::is_deaply
      works correctly on: perl 5.8.0 on Solaris x86 9

1.96 Sun 3rd July 2005
    - Removed String::ShellQuote - forgot to PREREQ and not using it

1.95 Sun 26th June 2005
    - Made export() work for address book, still missing encoding
      though.
    - Added basic test for export()
    - A few little clean up things

1.94 Sun 24th April 2005
    - Made check for 'VCARD' tag case insensative,
      probably won't help until Text::vFile::asData does as well.

1.93 Mon 31st Jan 2005
    - Restructured object so all nodes are stored in a hashref
      $self->{nodes} so I can get get_group to work, all other
      methods updated to reflect this.
    - added get_group() to vcard

1.92
    - Added group() to Node and extract that info
      from the vcard if it is there.

1.91
    - Doc bug, said 'tels', should have been 'tel'.

1.9
    - removed import() from docs as not used now
    - changed Node so excepts data with less than field order elements
      e.g. N, accepts 'Jon;Smith', As well as 'Jon;Smith;Dr;' this means
      we work better according to the RFC
    - ORGs' 'unit' method requires and returns an array ref as it is
      unlimited in the number of elements it has

1.8 Fri 15th Oct 2004
    - Applied patch from Aaron Cope for version stuff, can
      now access it as lowercase version().

1.7 Wed 13th Oct 2004
    - remembered to update module versions as well as makefile!

1.6 Wed 13th Oct 2004
    - removed import() and made anonsub again
    - removed version() as was conflicting with $VERSION,
      info can be accessed through other methods in anycase

1.5 Wed  Oct 6th 2004
    - Change to support asData change for 'type=home;type=pref'
    - Change to support escaped ; (\;) in data - 'note' now works

    - Added test for apple vcard version 3

    - added autogen methods; $vcard->fn(), $vcard->fullname($value)

1.1 Wed Sept 15th 2003
    - Lots of tests added
    - Restructured (it's Tom's fault) so we use Addressbook as the main
      interface, and Text::vCard is a single card, in the Addressbook object
    - Renamed add_type to add_types
    - Renamed remove_type to remove_types
    - Created Text::vCard::Node to replace all Text::vCard::Part*
